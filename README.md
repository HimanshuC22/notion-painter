## Introduction
IITinder? A Tinder for IITians? Yes but no.
Why no?
IITinder is not only meant for dating.

Okay, then how is it different from Tinder?
The motive of the app is kind of similar to Bumble BFF/Friender.
It should help IITians make new connections within and across institutions with the people (verified because they are your own batchmates) having similar interests.
Want to make new friends?
Need people to collaborate for a project? Need a salsa/prom night partner?
Need a person to go for a walk/library? Wanna try out casual dating?
Five problems, one solution -- IITinder.
